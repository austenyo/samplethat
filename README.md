# samplethat

This is an app which allows users to easily record samples, organize them, store them and upload or share them anywhere they want to. 

USAGE OF APP

When the user opens the app, they will see a the home screen with default colored folders already created. The user can then create a new folder by tapping on the plus sign at the top right of the screen, in the action bar, beside the SampleThat logo. Tapping on the plus sign prompts the user with a text-field to write the name of the new folder. If the user swipes on the folder in either direction, they are brought to the recording interface of the app. By tapping the recording tab, the app then activates the microphone on the user’s phone and records through it. The recorded file is then saved as an mp3 and is displayed directly below the recording tabs. Then, if the user taps on this mp3 recording, they are then given the option to upload the recording to different mediums: social networks, contacts and cloud storage such as dropbox. If the user decides to upload it to dropbox or any other cloud database, then all the user has to do is tap on that app’s icon and then they will be brought to the cloud storage app’s interface to see where in it the file is stored. They might also be given the option to rename the file, as in the case when pushing to dropbox, after they have uploaded the file to the cloud storage. 
Finally, to delete a folder the user can “tap and hold” on a folder on the home screen until a prompt is given that asks the user if they actually want to delete the folder. The user can then simply tap “yes” to delete the folder.
